"I think," James said, walking up and down their dormitory. "that these dates refer to the date that we meet our soulmates. Which means Lily is my soulmate! I met her on September first, on the Hogwarts Express, so it must be."

"You also met us on that day," Remus noted. "Peter could be your soulmate." Remus nodded over to the fat boy and Peter waved at James.

"Maybe not," James said quickly.

"Also, there's no year, so I could be a fourth year Hufflepuff, for all we know," Sirius noted.

"Even if you are right, that's pretty depressing, seeing as I'm probably not going to go into the 'Death Chamber' in the Department of Mysteries randomly," Remus said, glumly. "and that's my place."

"You might become and Unspeakable, Remus. You never know," Peter chimed in.

"And go to the Death Chamber. Right."

"Well, according to my parents, the date and place has something to do with your soulmate, so keep an eye out," James said, winking at him.

"They're in the Department of Mysteries?" Remus asked, incredulous. "What the hell are they thinking?"

Severus' silvery doe disappeared from in front of Remus and Sirius' eyes. Sirius let out a bark-like laugh.

"Love, do you know the date?" Sirius asked him. When Remus shook his head, Sirius tapped his forearm. "June eighteenth. And we're going to the Department of Mysteries."

"We're?" Remus noted, but Sirius ignored him.

"Something's going to happen with your soulmate."

"You, then?" Remus smirked. "Would be great, but you're not going to walk into the Ministry when they want you back in Azkaban."

"Sweet, but I'm going. Don't try to stop me."

There was a look in Sirius' eyes and Remus knew that arguing was pointless. Sirius was coming.

It was Remus' fault, really. He should've argued with Sirius more about going. Now he couldn't argue with Sirius anymore, because Sirius was dead.

Remus rubbed the tattoo on his arm.

June eighteenth, Death Chamber, Department of Mysteries.

Death date. It was his soulmate's death date and place. Really funny.
